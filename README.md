### MiniDB - An SQLite Clone implemented entirely in C ###

This is my effort to learn and understand the workings of a database system under the hood. I have a DBMS course this semester and learning about the various components of a DBMS and design choices that were made while designing a DBMS has really fascinated me. I want to know how to implement the theoretical concepts that I learnt in code.
